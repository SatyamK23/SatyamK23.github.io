Chess is simplified version of our life. In chess the player has to think of just 64 squares and 32 pieces but in life one has to make correct decision among infinitely many possibilities. White and Black pieces represent good and darker side of one’s personality. White and Black squares represents the decision one tends to make throughout their life. The person’s decision can be right or wrong and it must not oscillate between right or wrong decisions.

Few quotes of chess Grand Master who have related some aspect of life with chess[^1]

## Analogy of chess piece with Life
Here is my analogy for following pieces in chess board:
1. White Pieces:
- King and Queen represents father and mother respectively, who takes care of their child, similar to them taking care of army in chess by controlling the right position.
- As Rook is the next higher assigned score. Rook can be assumed as stability in life after getting jobs, done with marriage and having child.
- As Knight and Bishop has been assigned same score. This represents the learning phase of the child. Knight can be assumed as the child between 3 yr to 15 year, where he is molded into handle the society pressure. Bishop can be assumed as the maturity level of the child and adults.
- Pawn represents opportunities thrown to the humans. Some of the opportunities presented to us are jobs, ways of expanding knowledge, earning money.

2. Black Pieces:
- King and Queen represents the fight with other people, with ourselves like our greed, arrogance, violence. Behavior of people waiting for opportunity to defame one’s reputation.
- Rook represents the hurdles created in one’s life in getting a job, education.
- Knight, Bishop represents the understanding of concepts, subjects, society’s superstitious beliefs.
- Pawn represents the threats which are needed to make our self strong. This can be in the form of mistakes, losing or limiting their opportunities.

## Conclusion
- It is best to retrospect the consequences of what will happen if they did moved on lesser traveled path. It is similar to player making a move while thinking of past moves, his current status (any threats or capture possible) and also thinking of next 3–4 moves.
- Each person will learn something new about their decision as the time proceeds and he will try to get better at next step.
